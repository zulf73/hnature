ZULF MAKES RATIONAL DECISION: BILL GATES SAYS I AM AN UGLY 

Ladies and Gentlemen,

The crinkley skinned old fogey Bill Gates who looks like Emperor Palpatine calls me an 'ugly man'.  Should I believe him and have bad self-esteem?  Or should I believe more than 12 beautiful Russian women who gave me a 8.6+/-1.1 out of 10 in  romance site?  I think I will go with the Russian ladies.  I don't think whether Bill Gates thinks I am ugly matters more than the eyes of much prettier beholders.  That is the final answer Bill Gates.

Thank you,
ZULFIKAR MOINUDDIN AHMED

\section{What About What Women Think of Bill Gates?}

His wife leaves him at 66.  And what did my friend Tanya say?

And I quote:  "what power tricks they found dear?? oh that evil face!!"

\section{Rationality Leads to Dismissal of Bill Gates' opinion}

Male attractiveness is decided by potential romantic partners, not Bill Gates.  In my case, there are plenty of good looking women willing to give me a good grade, so Bill Gates opinions are trumped.  He is jealous, and who cares what he thinks?  He's ugly, inside and out.
