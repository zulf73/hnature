\section{Bill Gates is an Evil Cunt Demon}

What Bill Gates has done to me is so evil, abominable, horrific, vile, sick, disgusting, and so on that I have to spend some time just understanding who ought to be responsible.

\section{United States of America is complicit in creation of this Monster}

The United States of America has supported the success of this evil cunt Demon Bill Gates.  He ought to have been aborted {\em before birth} but instead he was allowed to be born and to succeed in America.  All those who were complicit in his success and did not eviscerate and kill him in the period 1955--2021 ought to be held responsible for this vile evil monster.
