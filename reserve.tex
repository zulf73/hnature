\maketitle

\section{What?}

We claim Right to destroy Bill Gates' Ancestral Meta, desecrate his Blood Meta, destroy his interior totally, mix his blood meta with poisonous military meta, siphon energy from his Life and Sexual meta, Destroy his Romantic Meta, damage his exoskeleton with Industrial meta.

\section{Why?}

These he has done to us.  We reserve the right to retaliate.  I am not interested in doing this but I am not seeing a great deal of understanding from the United States government about these horrific crimes against me.
