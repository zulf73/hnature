\title{Subtle Issues of American Vernacular: Cunt versus Bitch}

\section{Assumed Male Target}

In America cunt and bitch are both used sometimes against female targets. I will not address those cases.  I did not find those cases particularly interesting.  They are interesting particularly when the target is {\em male}. This not will clarify their differences.

\section{Cunt is not Sexual}

Despite its traditional literal meaning of 'female genitals', actual street or vernacular use of cunt is not sexual at all.  The fundamental charge is of {\em moral inadequacy}.  A cunt is both highly entitled as well as fundamentally untrustworthy and malevolent.  I won't go into details here.  It is almost never sexual. Why?  I don't know; it's simply how the natural language use evolved.

\section{Bitch is Sexual}

Bitch addressed to males is completely sexual and an attack on their masculinity.  In a strange twist of fate, American vernacular did not charge 'bitch' with any moral charge at all which is quite strange to me.  You see, in Bengal, 'son of a bitch' and 'son of a pig' etc. always have moral charge but in English 'bitch' with male target is simply a charge of male sexual impotence.  The insult is classical and must have existed in every language going back to Pleistocene, but the modern American vernacular simply charges this sexually and morally which is uncommon for curses.

I won't interpret it too much.  This is from May 15 2021.  While Bill Gates is still alive, his reputation is much more vulnerable than if he were dead.  That's just a fact of human nature.  Human beings despise people who talk ill of the deceased.
