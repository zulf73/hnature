\maketitle

Paperwork and Passport is one thing but there is much more to being American.  American-ness is a religion, and that religion is sacredness of Natural Rights of all Human Beings.  We believe that all men are created equal with inalienable Natural Rights of Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness.  That's the American creed.  We can be stepping out of Mayflower and still not be American enough.  We need to believe the American creed to be truly American.  I am American because for me Natural Rights of all people are sacred.  

\section{Bill Gates is a Blasphemer against American Creed}

Bill Gates not only deeply violated my Natural Rights with Industrial and other Powers, but he {\em blasphemes} against our creed, he desecrates the sacred foundations of our Nation, the sanctity of Natural Rights of all people.  He is a traitor to our Nation.

\section{My Expectations of American Coalition against Natural Rights Violation by Bill Gates}

Americans support natural rights anyway; my contention is that belief in the sacredness of {\em universal} natural rights inviolable including Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness actually {\em distinguishes Americans} from other peoples of the world. 

Suppose I create a coalition against Bill Gates citing his violation of my own Natural Rights (using meta powers) such as violation of my Body, Life, Family, Sexual, Romantic, Ancestral meta, then how many Americans would support me?  The following is from \cite{AR}:

I should be able to get support roughly from 70 percent of Americans who are strongly in favour of Natural Rights and believe that Americans have more in common with each other than people think, and I am American so they would conclude the same about me, and that would get me a quorum enough to consider a complete re-working of Bill Gates reputation in America.
