\maketitle
The 2011 study of Aqeel Khan, Saedah Siraj and Li tells us some interesting correlates of Big Five for stress coping mechanisms.

What is remarkable here is a decomposition by big five traits.

Openness stress coping involves low emotional support, substance abuse, self-blame, and high instrumental support, acceptance, venting.

Extraversion stress coping involves low behavioral disengagement, emotional support and self distraction, and high positive reframing and instrumental support.

Conscientiousness stress coping involves low emotional support, self-distraction, substance abuse and high humour.

Neuroticism stress coping involves high self-distraction, self-blame, emotional support, low venting.

\section{Need for Evolutionary Explanations}

The stress coping mechanisms that are exhibited are all functions of evolutionary adaptations.  We are interested in evolutionary explanations of universal virtues, and understanding the variation of Character in human beings.
