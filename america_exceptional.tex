\section{Foundation on Securing Natural Rights}

America was founded on securing of Natural Rights of all Americans.  That is the first source of exceptional nature of America.  But that's well understood.

\section{That I Am Here}

The first source is not enough, and the key to America's Exceptional Nature is actually that I am here in the country and made it my home.  You see, this is serendipity.  It's obvious to me that if I had stayed in Bengal then Bengal would be Exceptional; if I had moved to China then China would be Exceptional; if I had moved to Iran then Iran would be Exceptional.  But I moved to America, so America is Exceptional.  This is as simple for me to understand as the air I breathe.
