\section{Total Eradication of Bill Gates}

The central component of my plan is to not just kill Bill Gates physically with lethal force of US Government, but to systematically erase all Evil influence of Bill Gates from all Human Affairs and deep cleanse the Human Mind and Soul from all Evil Bill Gates Demonic influence.  This will immediately remove much of the Malevolence that is causing misery and suffering of my Beloved People the Human Race.

\section{Cost Effective}

Just with total destruction and annihilation of a single person, we can produce the conditions for the Post-Bill Gates World Order which is based on Goodness and Tolerance and end of Exploitation and Slavery, where more people can enjoy more money and so on.
