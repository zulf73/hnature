\section{The Dark Ages With Regards Ethnicity and Race say 75,000 BP - 2021}

The pre-Zulf Enlightenment Era regarding Ethnicity and Race in Human Species history extends from 75,000 BP to 2021.  In this long period, Human Race was not actually aware that they were a {\em Single Race}.  There were some sporadic attempts to this understanding, especially in the twentieth century, and even at the founding of America when Thomas Paine had declared 'world is my country and all men my brethren' but nothing substantial occurred until 2021 and the great quantitative results of Zulf, i.e. Zulfikar Moinuddin Ahmed, who, without any institutional support, living at 48 with his aunt in Allen, Texas, first rigorously showed on empirical data that the ethnicity effect on Human Nature Moral Values are around 6.5-9.5\% of the variation.  Before this great scientific work of Zulf, Human Race was simply living in confusion regarding issues of race and ethnicity.  Only by showing that Human {\em Moral} Nature is mostly independent of Ethnicity or Race could Human Race have the necessary Enlightenment, the necessary Light of Knowledge, that allowed Human Race to abandon the Barbarism of its past.
