\section{Kant Centered around Good Will}

Kant followed Aristotle and considered Reason to be Human Nature.  Then he focused on Good Will to be the only good in itself.

\section{Reason is not Human Nature}

I have considered that rationality is not Human Nature at all and was Socrates' propaganda.  I am not interested fundamentally in being a frivolous contrarian here but simply accurate versus Nature.  We are human and some of us are able to master some part of Reason but it is not and has never been embedded faithfully in Human Nature.  That is simply the truth.  

Not Reason but habituation gives us Virtues and Character.
