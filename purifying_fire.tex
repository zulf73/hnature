\title{Zulf's Crucible For Purifying Human Morality Using Bill Gates as Example}

\maketitle

A crucible is a ceramic or metal container where metals are melted at high temperature.  Bill Gate is so exceptionally evil and malevolent and criminal and without any moral compass that I am thinking of purifying the moral ardor of the entire Human Race using him as subject.  The idea is of course classical that one's moral character develops in purifying fire of a crucible, like producing pure metals at high temperatures.  But this requires effort.  From my point of view, the exceptional evil of Bill Gates is a great opportunity to literally tune the moral ardor of 7.8 billion people.  

You see, Human Nature is responsible for moral values.  I have found that around 95\% of human beings have good moral values, and around 5\% are compromised or deviant.  Therefore a great unity of moral outrage towards Bill Gates will cleansed and purify the moral ardour of 95\% of the human race if I can get this working.

Let's take a look at my beautiful poster.

This is very good, if I say so myself.  It has the purifying fire in the background, a real pyre, representing the cleansing and purifying of the soul.  And it mentions 'Evil' and 'Moral Compass', and 'Malevolent'.  Now Bill Gates is all of these things, and it is quite rare, because 95\% of human race are good moral people, so it's an opportunity to use Bill Gates properly for a religious renaissance.  Unlike Satan Bill Gates is an actual living person, a specimen of Pure Evil, and fascinating because he's not just inactive but constantly committing more evil.  He might literally sacrifice himself to light the moral fires of my Beloved People, the Human Race, and since he harmed my eyes, I don't feel all that bad just using him for my grand purposes.

\section{Elements of a New Universal Religion}

I was thinking about the failures of old religions and the elements of a new Universal Religion.  I think the important thing is to stay close to Classical Liberalism, and also to focus on Life Satisfaction rather than Hell as the constraint.  Rather than saying "Do such and such or you will burn in Hell, we should say, do such and such or face reduction of Life Satisfaction that no one can return to you".  Other elements include proof of Eternal Recurrence.  It is not that Empiricism and Scientism is compelling at all; they are not.  But going against strong research is folly regardless.  And I don't think 95\% of the world need all sorts of coercion rather than clear knowledge.  Some things are better with empirical results; others are much more mysterious unknown of Nature.  These latter do require mythologies. But it is not impressive for us to have religions many of whose elements reduce life satisfaction.

\section{My Sexual Opinions and Convictions}

My sexual convictions and mores are quite strong.  First, regarding homosexuality, my views are as follows.  I believe that people have Natural Rights to love who they want, fuck who they want, and it is not anyone's goddam business to get involved in their private love life.  This implies I believe that it is very important to secure Natural Rights of homosexuals around the world.  At the same time, I am strongly heterosexual, and I don't care too much about the trials and tribulations of homosexual love life.  I don't care all that much because I am obsessed with my heterosexuality.  I find it extremely offensive when people accuse me of homosexuality (which has happened) and I will happily take a baseball bat and smash their heads into a bloody pulp if they do that.  I am extremely proud of my heterosexuality and I consider highly denigrating when people denigrate it.  I also do not appreciate anyone getting into my private love life at all.  I'll take a shotgun and blow the head off any mother fucker who, without proper permission, gets involved in my love life.  It's private affair. 

I don't think that it is wrong to cohabit without marriage or have sex before marriage but I do consider marriage to be an important and sacred institution and I think single motherhood is a total disaster and ought to be prevented globally.

These views are different from traditional Christianity and Islam and more correct than the views in these religions.
