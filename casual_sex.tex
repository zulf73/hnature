\section{Distribution of Casual Sex Never Justiable in the World}

The following is distribution of people who believe casual sex is never justifiable.

The mean of this distribution is 42.88\% which is much higher than the American percent 17.9\%.  

\section{My views}
I think Casual Sex is almost always justified.  I don't believe that sex is justified for minors under 18 at all, even for boys, and that that could be a criminal matter or at least a matter for public concern.  But for adults, mutual consent is primary.  I believe that Natural Right of Liberty extends here for consenting adults to have or not have casual sex and it is not anyone else's business.  I do think that both partners are responsible children born out of casual sex.  But I don't generally get overly concerned with other people's sex lives; I think people have a right to have whatever sort of private lives they want provided criminal laws are not violated.

Having said that I do not sleep with women I do not love, and that is my own development, and I do this for my own sanity and happiness.  I feel that it would desecrate important sacred spaces for me to sleep with a woman I did not love.  But I have had a number of live-in lovers over the years and I do not care for moral police on my private life.  It is no one's business but mine.

\section{How Did Occur}
I was born in Bengal in a Muslim household, and statistics make it clear that close to 80\% consider casual sex unjustifiable.  I can therefore infer, at 48, that somehow my sexual values have not been inherited from Bengali society.  I got married soon after college to my ex-wife Natalia Brizuela and we were young and things did not work out between us.  I then was with a Danish woman I met at MIT from 1999-2002 in Cambridge and New York.  I was living in New York, so I can trace my {\em development} of values from teenage years in New York through Princeton when I was a virgin to later life when probably Sine Jensen influenced me in some way that led to my relaxation about sexuality.  I am probably closer in values to Europe than even America.  

\section{Understanding Sexual Mores of the Human Race}

Sexual mores of the Human Race is far more conservative than my own. Thus I consider it important to find some way of understanding and engaging with a variety of sexual mores in a reasonable way.
