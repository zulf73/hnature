\section{Introduction}

Some things have deeper evolutionary drives than others.  We have been out of Arica for 75,000 years and it is fascinating to understand how we are the same across the globe and how we are different.

I also have a nice Bayesian paradigm to test out some issues of inference.  So I thought it would be interesting to examine the probability that we will think {\em Unselfishness} is important to cultivate in our children.
