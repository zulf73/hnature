\section{Zulf's America is the Real America from 33 Years of Experience}

The Real America, in the end, is Zulf's America.  In the last century, a Frenchman, Alexis de Toqueville, was one of the most profound perceptive analysts of America.  And then there is the photography of Robert Frank.  Robert Frank was a {\em Swiss} photographer who had some of the greatest post-war photography in his {\em The Americans}.  He was American by life.  And I, Zulfikar Moinuddin Ahmed, born in Bengal, am also American, and I have been toying with the idea of "Zulf's America" for many years, and I want to begin telling you about my America, the {\em Real America}.
