\section{Simple Facts that Bill Gates Finds Impossible to Grasp}

The strength of the evidence that all non-Africans had ancestors in East Africa roughly 75,000 years is quite remarkably strong.  There are peer-reviewed Science papers detailing the evidence.  Bill Gates cannot grasp the scientific evidence at all and failing to grasp the evidence, he reacts violently relying on his convictions which include such absurdities as "Hammurabi was white". 

In both stupidity -- the inability to examine and accept scientific work of consensus -- and the violent reaction to it, including not paying me \$120 million when he makes money off my work in Medium Frequency Strategy, is remarkable enough to write down in a formal note.

\section{Bill Gates Documentaries are all Fictional}
The legendary intelligence of Bill Gates at IQ 160 is of course completely fabricated.  His actual IQ is much lower, probably not even my 135-140.  I am not the fastest person, and usually run out of time on some of the harder problems at the end of an IQ exam but I can do them with longer time.
