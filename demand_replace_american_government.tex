\section{I Stand On Declaration of Independence}

Declaration of Independence says that American Goverment exists to secure my Natural Rights as an American.  I have found that American Government in its current form has failed to secure my Natural Rights against the assaults of malevolent Demon Bill Gates.  Therefore I will demand a total dissolution of the entire United States Government and its replacement by a new Government that is capable of securing my Natural Rights and those of my 320 million fellow Americans.  

\section{United States is a Classical Liberal Multi-Ethnic Democratic Republic}

United States Government exists primarily to secure Natural Rights of all Americans.  If they are unable to comply with the primary goal, I ought to demand a total replacement of the entire United States Government.
