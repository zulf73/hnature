\section{Evolutionary Hypothesis}

We hypothesize that these deviations arose from 75,000 years of evolutionary changes.

This gives us a rough gauge of speed of human moral evolution.  

\section{Zulf's Speed of Moral Evolution Conjecture}

I will claim that the speed of moral evolution of human race is roughly $10^{-4}$ percent per year.  This is roughly 8/75000.

Scientific consensus today is that non-Africans spread from East Africa 75k BP.  Our hypothesis is that the divergences by ethnicity is due to evolutionary changes at a scale of about $r=1e-4$ percent points per year.

The estimate is not meant to be sharp but it does require some more work to 
establish.
