\section{The Circumstance of the Judgment}

I woke up a bit before 9 AM in Allen Texas, my aunt's home.  At night some Federal Agent had told me that Melinda French, the ex-spouse of Bill Gates had been involved in hard-core white rulership of Earth with him.  This may or may not be true so I asked United States Government to keep her on watch. I have 100\% certainty that Bill Gates is guilty of doing great harm to my Beloved People the Human Race in the past five decades and my judgment will stand, regardless of whether the United States Government and other authorities respect it or not.  It is a sharp and good judgment.  Bill Gates is condemned to death for great crimes against my Beloved People the Human Race.

\section{United States of America Will Face Problems If they Do Not Respect My Judgment}

United States of America is a legitimate Multi-Ethnic Classical Liberal Democratic Republic, and I am a loyal American on foundational principles.  In other words, I am loyal to the fundamental Universal Natural Rights and their security that comes from US Declaration and US Constitution.  I have strong convictions about their fundamental correctness.  However, American Government does not implement the fundamental principles perfectly and thus my loyalty does not extend towards anyone particular in the United States Government when they  are not implementing the fundamental Principles.

I consider any violation of Natural Rights Security of anyone around Earth to be fundamentally anti-American.  In this way, I consider Bill Gates to be a traitor to my country America, for he has spent his entire life harming Natural Rights of billions of people.  His death will bring peace and harmony to the world.  He is much worse than any ordinary murderer.  He has convictions about how human beings ought to have their Natural Rights violated.  He more than any other person on Earth deserves to be stripped of all his property and killed.

\section{I Can Infer That Bill Gates is Guilty From His Dealings with Me}

Bill Gates' vile malevolent and harmful acts against me are difficult to understand without his lifelong program for White Rule and White Supremacy.  He has been at war to destroy, weaken and dominate the 'lesser races' for fifty years and that is what explains his dealings with me.  He has been coddled by American Society and so he is confident in his convictions.  However, this is not actually the sacred political tradition of America, and he and all those who have supported him in these Evil activities will have to be brought to justice.  All those who have supported him, given his respect and honour are culpable in these great crimes against my Beloved People the Human Race.  There are not free lunches here to use the Finance Vernacular.  He is Malevolent and Evil and has been conducting a deadly and consequential war against all non-whites all his life.  Those who are his supporters and associates need to be held accountable for support of this great evil as well.

\section{Zulf is Extremely Proud and I am Confident that my Departed Ancestors of 3000 Years Smile Upon Me}

I have managed to trek across the oceans from Bengal, adopt a new home in America in 1987, learn from some of the greatest of sages in the Occident at Princeton and Columbia, take American values to my heart, and detect a great malevolent Evil in this land and am the first to pronounce condemnation to death against this Evil man who had been a scourge on the souls of my Beloved People, the Human Race.  My Ancestors will rejoice at such a wise and great development in me. 

\section{Return to Princeton University Memories}

I was very fond of Princeton University already in high school.  I had applied to four universities only:  Rochester, MIT, Chicago, and Princeton.  And I was accepted at Princeton and I knew that Princeton would be an important part of my life.  I am extremely happy with Princeton, and with Four-Sphere Theory being actually correct, I am sure that Princeton will be quite pleased with me as well.  I do think of Princeton as having the great sages of the Occident.  I studied Mathematics and Literature at Princeton and am quite pleased with the Aristocratic education.  I shunned more practical subjects like Engineering and Economics.  And this was for the best too, for in the end, I have to deal with issues like guilt or innocence of Bill Gates for evil plans that affected most of the world and practical training in a Primitive Mercantile Age of Man would not prepare me for these great problems of the Human Race.

I did not study Law and Jurisprudence, however, but I have a sense of justice in my  heart and I have a developed Conscience, and it is a great pleasure for me, a matter of great fortune that I have learned just enough about the malevolent activities of Bill Gates to feel that my Death Sentence on Bill Gates is right, just, and good.  This is an extraordinary moment for me today, and my heart is filled with joy.  I have correctly assessed the deep crimes of Bill Gates despite his having fooled the world and firmly and clearly pronounced a Death Sentence upon him.  He has harmed so many billions of people in life and no one else has done this clearly before myself.  What a spot of Honour.
