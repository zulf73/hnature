\section{Zulf has pushed physics past Schroedinger and Einstein}

Bill Gates is totally illiterate and does not know anything about science or finance and has spent his illiterate life manipulating gullible technology workers.  Zulf has advanced physics past Einstein and Schroedinger, and has given humanity its most correct and advanced law of electromagnetism.  These primitive savage illiterate backward people like Bill Gates cannot comprehend the sharp precision of prediction of redshift slope simultaneously with width of electron.  

\section{Zulf has taken Science far past Immanuel Kant and David Hume}

My discoveries in Moral Nature of Man and my Markov Moral Model for the Human Race is the most advanced scientific model that exists in the world.  Indeed this is the only correct model at the moment, and all other theories of morality are pre-scientific by comparison.  Bill Gates' backward primitive savage views about ethnicity are diametrically opposed to the most advanced and accurate work ever done on Human Moral Nature by myself.
