\section{Results}

Let $S$ be Life Satisfaction, $H$ Happiness, $FI$ family important, $NFI$ family not important.  We have the following empirical estimates.

\begin{eqnarray*}
P(H|FI) &= 0.8675\\
P(H|NFI) &= 0.6825\\
P(S|FI) &= 0.217\\
P(S|NFI) &= 0.389
\end{eqnarray*}

The divergence here in Happiness and Life Satisfaction is remarkable, and I am quite fortunate to find this very intriguing phenomenon.
Life Satisfaction of Human Beings remains a deep mystery of Nature and this anomalous finding might lead us to understand the phenomenon better.  One of the great problems of this entire Age is that Life Satisfaction for a vast majority of Human Race is dismal.  Our discovery shows clearly that we ought not consider Life Satisfaction simply a rough proxy for Feelings of Happiness at all.  They behave quite differently.
