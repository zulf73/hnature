\maketitle

The work of Serota, Levine and Boster \cite{SLB} leads to an $R^2=0.7$ fit of an exponential model of per-day lying with 60\% who do not lie at all and the liars following an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda=0.42$.

We define pathological liar as someone who tells 20+ lies per day.  The easy estimate for the number of pathological liars on Earth is
\[
p\ell = 56m
\]
Now 56 million people is quite a large estimate, but the rest would be quite bounded in their lies per day.  The total population of not too dishonest people is 7,744 million.
