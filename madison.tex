\section{James Madison's Major Idea}

James Madison's major contribution to the construction of the successful Multi-Ethnic Classical Liberal Democratic Republic of America was the problem of the problem of populist mobs.  James Madison did not like the country to be governed by the wild animal emotions of the populist mobs which would be a serious problem in a pure democracy.  He therefore thought about the Senate and the House as a sort of refining role, which scans through the wild demands of the crowds and fashions laws that refine them and make them coherent with the US Constitution.  I personally would like to see the US Declaration Preamble given more strength in considerations of House and Senate.

\section{New Problems of Pure Democracy that are Universal Discovered by Myself}

My fellow Princetonian James Madison was a great man, but I, Zulfikar Moinuddin Ahmed, have new knowledge that he did not have access to.  I am not worried so much about the wild animal spirits of the mobs at the moment; perhaps in 1770s I would be, but today I am not so worried.  Today I am worried about other problems of democracy.

Let me show you some numbers.  Let's start with 'interest in politics' of my Beloved People the Human Race.

This is a global picture.  The interest in politics curves have minor variation by ethnicity.  

\begin{verbatim}
> rowSums(intpol[,1:2])
     Black East Asian     Indian      Other      White 
 0.3552207  0.3928337  0.3952484  0.5149091  0.3617562 

\end{verbatim}
 
My distinguished predecessor James Madison and his contemporaries simply did not know that Human Nature has this feature that 40\% of the Human Race were interested in politics and 60\% were simply {\em not interested in politics}.  Not knowing this crucial fact about Human Race, they were speculating about the problems that will arise and to produce solutions for them.  

Now our foundational document US Declaration does make clear that the main purpose of Government will be to secure Natural Rights of all Americans.  This is great, but the American Democratic Republic makes the implicit assumption that it is a government by consent of the governed.  But with 60\% of the American people {\em simply not interested in politics} the government is no optimal for the fundamental task of securing Natural Rights.  American government has many different shortcomings, but this is a major structural issue. 

I have various proposals to remedy the situation.  I am quite convinced that the current Senate and House in Washington are not at the level where fine tuned solutions are appropriate.  The current Legislature do not even understand their purpose, and collude with criminal evil white supremacists like Bill Gates and conspire to violate the Natural Rights of Great Americans like myself who are far more foresighted and wise than James Madison.
