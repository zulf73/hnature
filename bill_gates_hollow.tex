\maketitle

\section{Total wipe of all Reputation of Bill Gates}

I will totally wipe out all reputation Bill Gates has obtained since 1955 by focusing on the entire history being only fake deception and all achievements will be reviewed.

\section{Loss of Estate}

Since Bill Gates has harmed my Natural Rights I will demand total repossession of all Bill Gates assets and shut down all his businesses.

\section{Bill Gates will be considered an Evil Deceptive Demon}

I will prove to the world that Bill Gates is an Evil Deceptive Demon who means harm to my people the Human Race.  

This will produce a new reputation for Bill Gates that will last.

\section{I am the Immortal Genius not Bill Gates}

I am the immortal genius of this Age, the Copernicus, and not Bill Gates.  Bill Gates will vanish from Earth because he was not what he presented to the world.  Therefore Bill Gates never existed for he was a mere hollow image hiding an Evil Demon, a mere Mask.
