\section{Motivation}

Whatever is the truth is the truth.  Many people such as Bill Gates are convinced that White and Non-White people differ substantially and White People are superior.  There are other incarnations of attitudes of ethnic chauvinism of various types.  These things cannot be resolved either way without {\em measurements}.  My personal views on this matter is extremely clear: it is not intelligent or rational to speak of 'superiority' with vast groups that overlap indistinguishably with large dispersions.

Now our first discovery of universal human nature has been the discovery of many values that have uniform exponential curves with $\lambda \in (0.49 - 0.18, 0.49 + 0.18)$.  Since this question of whether White values differ from Non-White values is literally affecting massive harm to my Natural Rights by Bill Gates who has all sorts of 'convictions'regarding this issue, I decided to consider a fine tuned consideration.  

We can roughly associate a single $\lambda$ to each country and find that for large number of values the standard deviation across different values is $0.002$ which means that the within-country standard deviation is quite a bit smaller than the global variation 0.18.  Now from our point of view the spread 0.18 might seem quite tame, from a hard-core racial perspective, or nationalist perspective, this is not constant enough for $\lambda$.  They might be tempted to hypothesize that 0.18 is large and want to make a mountain out of a molehill in a lambda difference of 0.05 hypothetically and jerrymander the countries by race and try to claim that Whites are Superior in Values and ought to Conquer and Rule over the lesser peoples of the world.

We are generous and will give them an opportunity.  We will do a fair and square analysis next to see if there is a statistical difference between the White Countries $\lambda$ and the Non-White Countries.  If we find a statistical difference we will give the White Supremacists a chance to make their case that even though the global $\sigma(\lambda)= 0.18$ is pretty small to us, it's actually the difference between the gods and the unworthy when there is a difference of 0.05 say and allow them to completely exaggerate the difference and use it as a justification to enslave, torture, bomb, plunder and take all their stuff.  Ok?

\section{Procedure}

We took 49 countries and created a group vector with values 'w' for white country and 'n' for white country.  We put United States -- which is a Multi-Ethnic Classical Liberal Democratic Republic with 60 percent whites and 40 percent nonwhites as 'w' to assuage people who think it is Whitelandia.  Then we perform a t-test as follows.

\begin{verbatim}
> Gg %>% pairwise_t_test(Q60 ~ grp,p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")
# A tibble: 1 x 9
  .y.   group1 group2    n1    n2     p
* <chr> <chr>  <chr>  <int> <int> <dbl>
1 Q60   n      w         39    10 0.642
# â€¦ with 3 more variables: p.signif <chr>,
#   p.adj <dbl>, p.adj.signif <chr>

\end{verbatim}

Aw, that's too bad.  The p-value of $p=0.642$ gives no distinguishability for these $\lambda$ estimates. 

\section{White Values on Earth do not Differ from Non-White Values}

I used Q58 to test with 10 white and 39 non-white countries.  I expect white values to be indistinguishable from non-white values more generally.  

\section{Suggestions for Further Things for White Supremacists}

White Supremacists don't seem to get any solid distinguishability in {\em Values} from our work.  I suggest using a different approach, which is irrationally claiming that Whites are Superior to Non-Whites not because of any rational reason but because "We say so".  This approach is more defensible.
