\epigraph{Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say moreI can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breatheSo I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables}{Adele, "Turning Tables"}
\section{How We Raise Children}

Arabs are an outlier here but for all other ethnicies, the differences are negligible.

\section{Conclusion}
Our values that we pass on, or want to pass on to children have negligible differences by ethnicity.  This supports the Single Human Race.
