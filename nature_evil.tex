\section{Nature of Evil Can be Characterised}

I was Atheist completely from 1979 roughly to 2008 at least.  So I am not habituated to thinking about Nature of Evil seriously.  

I have not been an Empiricist Atheist since 2008, probably earlier already.  I did not encounter true evil before about six months to a year ago since I had to deal with Bill Gates.  There have been bad people, criminals thieves and robbers, liars and cheats I had encountered before but they were not interesting.  Bill Gates is destructively malevolent.  He is {\em true evil} the first specimen of this type I have encountered.  Now my estimate of bad people among white ethnics is around 2.5\%.  He is far more rare than this.  I would say he is perhaps 500 out of 200 million, $2.5 \times 10^{-6}$ rather than $2.5\times 10^{-2}$, about more 1/10,000 among bad people.  I am tempted to put Evil in actual people to this sort of range, where among bad people Evil lies in less than 1\% of the bad people.  This is not scientific, but it is valuable to put Evil in a scale of rarity {\em among bad people}.  This would be an advance in understanding Evil, for it is really annoying for me to hear the religious myths of Good and Evil after a while because they are out of context if the phenomena never actually arises.  What is clear from my work is bad people exist, and with Bill Gates as example, Evil people exist and can be placed in a tail of bad people.  That is my first observation about Evil, that it does exist on Earth in people, but it is quantitatively rare.

\section{Good and Evil are not Mirrors}

It is tempting to consider Good and Evil as duality.  They are not mirrors at all.  Evil has certain key properties that are suboptimal, asymmetric.  Evil requires deformation of Truth.  That is the first deep observation that is valid.  Evil cannot appreciate Truth.  Evil continually either must deform truth or destroy truth.  Thus deception, deliberate lies, manipulative behaviour is second nature to Evil.  In the case of Bill Gates, this is his "PR" self-promotion of extreme intellectual abilities, exaggerated IQ of 160, his fake reading habits which pretend that he, who was never a diligent student at Harvard, has been even more diligent than those like myself who actually had to pass many difficult exams and write theses to graduate from Ivy League Universities and actually have experience with rigours of study and intellectual work.  This sort of unabashed shameless deception is characteristic of Evil.  Truth is the first casualty of Evil, for Evil cannot thrive without Deception.  Bill Gates deceived the entire world for decades and gained great wealth and power by murders, extortion, vile abomination of malicious malevolence with various collection of power.

\section{Evil Cannot Comprehend Fate}

Evil is constantly obsessed with Control of all things and cannot comprehend Fate at all.

\section{How Do I Know That Bill Gates Self-Promotion Are all Lies?}

I have dealt with the Evil Demon in meta for six months, and he keeps repeating "PR" on all sorts of things.  None of his self-promotion has any truth to it {\em at all}, not even an iota.  He totally makes up stories about himself that have absolutely no basis in any truth at all.  The idea that Bill Gates would actually look for any newspaper vendor is totally out of the question.  The man spends day and night finding various ways to find the power to kill all non-whites, destroy them, take their money and destroy their lives, considering it the right of rich man.  He calls me 'quarry'.  So all that people know about Bill Gates from his public presentation are pure fiction and has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual Bill Gates who is by far the most Evil man the human race has ever produced.

\section{What We Ought to Do}

\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{fire.jpeg}

The lies about small things is not the problem; the problem is that all of his self-propaganda is pure fiction giving the impression that he is a good man.  He is nothing of the sort and his self-promoting fiction is not just a bit erroneous but complete lies and fabrication, a fictional creation.  In actuality he is by far the most malevolent being this planet has ever produced.  The harm he had done to my eyes was considered by Christine Lagarde of ECB and no Nazi has caused as much harm to any Jewish eyes as he had caused to me.  He must be eviscerated, and his body must be burned in fire to purify the Earth.  The United States ought to do this for his vile violation of my Natural Rights.
