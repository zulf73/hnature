\section{Basic Data}

\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{eth_viol.png}

Another day goes by and I already have a sense that roughly ethnicity effects on moral values regarding violence against other people will be roughly bounded by 9.5\%. Visually the curves are close to each other, so we do not expect egregious differences based on ethnicity for entire spectrum of values.

It would be interesting now to examine fits of our latest model for the curves to all the ethnicities.

\section{Tight Bounds for Mass on 1-5 for All Ethnicities}

I want to point out that the total mass on 1-5 for this variable for all ethnicities is actually around 3\%.  And that is a remarkably tight bound.  

Let's look at that data.

1 & Arab & 0.9769 \\ 
  2 & Black & 0.9148 \\ 
  3 & East Asian & 0.9429 \\ 
  4 & Indian & 0.9517 \\ 
  5 & Other & 0.8928 \\ 
  6 & White & 0.9329 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The standard deviation of the second column is 2.93\%.

If we step back and consider this in context of the actual world, this is one of the most remarkable regularities ever discovered about our people the Human Race, that across the globe, the moral values regarding violence against other people in this sort of collapse is only 2.93\%.  The actual percentage figure is important, but I want to just marvel at the uniformity in this moral value.  It is just beautiful, surprising, and astounding.  This is sufficient to permanently end all conflicts based on ethnic superiority based on moral values.  It will be very difficult for anyone to prove that they are different enough by ethnicity to have much significance.

\section{Regularity of Moral Values in Ethnicity is my Discovery}

I, Zulfikar Moinuddin Ahmed, am solely responsible for this regularity of moral values by ethnicity. It is such an important discovery that it will change the future trajectore of the entire species Homo Sapiens.  I have tremendous amount of Self-Interest to ensure that I, and only I, am credited with this great discovery.

\section{Code}

You can obtain the data from Wave 7 of World Values Survey \cite{WVSData}.  At the bottom of the page there are Statistical Data files.  Pick the R data.  You will need 'readRDS' to pull it into R.

\section{Results for All Morals}

These are variations due to ethnicity of the total mass in 1-5 for each question.  These are standard deviation figures.  The mean across different moral values is 6.57\% with standard deviation 4.4\%.  There are some obvious outliers.  This is a great discovery regardless.  We have here {\em bounded} the ethnic effects of human race moral values fairly tightly.

\section{The Results Here are Extremely Solid}

World Values Survey has very high quality public data, and the analysis here is quite simple.  The substance of the discovery is not new sophisticated analysis in this note but the remarkable simple inference that ethnicity effects on the total mass of people who report 1-5 for non-justifiability of violence against other people is just 2.93\%.  This is a discovery of natural Science of the highest import, and I deserve to be recorded in history of Civilisation for having discovered this absolutely crucial phenomenon that will be required for future peace and harmony of planet Earth in the future.  

This discovery of natural science is far greater than anything done by Isaac Newton or Erwin Schroedinger or even Charles Darwin, none of whom could have even suspected this regularity in human morals across ethnicities and continents.

\section{My Own Ideas About Ethnicity}

I was never particularly racial or ethnic oriented.  When I was very young, in Bengal, I took to English Romantics in my private interests, and before too long I was in a multi-ethnic public high school in New York in 1987 and did not have any racial feelings towards anyone.  Then Princeton from 1991--1995.  I was of course aware vaguely that I was not the same ethnicity as the white students at Princeton, or the black or hispanic ones, but it did not really register in my mind.  I was always elitist of course, but never racial or ethnic oriented.  I have been very fortunate in this way.  The first time I really began to think that white supremacy in America is problematic was in 2008.  And now of course the horrific revelations about the worthless talentless illiterate cunt Bill Gates who screwed me over for money and is promoting a White Supremacist World Order.  If he were not so serious I would think it's a fucking joke.  But it's not a joke.  This cunt needs to be beat to a pulp and bombed out of existence, this Bill Gates.  But I am not anti-white or anything. I just think it would be fun to pour gasoline buckets on Bill Gates and burn him in the middle of a large stadium with HDTV to the entire world.
