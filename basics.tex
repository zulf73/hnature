\section{Surprises In Basics}

The importance of religion in life reduces {\em life satisfaction} and that of politics in life reduces both happiness and life satisfaction.  These are fundamental features of human race and ought to be known in every fifth grade.  

\section{Relative Importance}

These are obvious but since importance of family in life is the highest, we can compare the rest to it.  

We consider life satisfaction as primary.  Then we have the basic rule of thumb.

Family is 4 times more important than friends.

Family is 3 times more important than leisure time.

Family is 10 times more important than work.
