\section{The Curves}

These curves are very similar to opinions about beating wife a bit slower decay.  Next we consider cumulative percentages for 1-5.

  5 & Other & 79.97 \\ 
  6 & White & 89.24 \\

Let's look at the effect of ethnicities.

  \hline
 & eth & explained \\ 
  \hline
1 & Arab & 1.31 \\ 
  2 & Black & 2.50 \\ 
  3 & East Asian & 5.47 \\ 
  4 & Indian & 4.70 \\ 
  5 & Other & 2.17 \\ 
  6 & White & 2.78 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Once again, 5\% is maximum explained by ethnicity and we consider this to be negligible compared to the mean curve.

\section{Conclusions}

I personally think beating children is horrible and am myself on the 1=never justified scale.  Children are not toys or possessions.  They are scarred for life by abuse.  They deserve to be treated with care and respect.  All theories of how discipline requires beating children are barbaric and totally insane.  My conclusion is that you ought to propagate the idea that beating children is wrong and people should stop doing it.
