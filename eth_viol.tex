Let us take a look at non-violent people by ethnicity.

This is quite interesting because Arabs are the least violent ethnicity here, and whites are more violent than blacks.  Both f these are quite far from the racial propaganda that I find propagating in America routinely.

Regardless, the sober assessment here is that roughly 95\% of all ethnicities are peaceful people.

Now let us record the ethnicity effect on violence.
