\section{Return to Morals and Life Satisfaction}

I have showed earlier that Life Satisfaction increases with moral values.  Here we take a closer look at Life Satifaction versus Moral Values regarding Justification of Violence. This is truly beautiful and a strong vindication of Aristotle's Virtue Theory.

I, Zulfikar Moinuddin Ahmed, have the immortal claim to have shown the great Aristotle's Virtue Theory actually produces increase in Life Satisfaction and his eudaimonia theory for these Virtues is actually right for the actual Human Race living today.  I shall be the great immortal genius to have clearly shown this to my Beloved People the Human Race.

I do not want Bill Gates trying to sell all sorts of rubbish about how my great results are actually due to any white supremacist crony of his.  I cannot stand the glib White Supremacist charlatan without an iota of talent in anything who is a Hellspawn Abomination.  I never thought I would meet one of his kind outside Inferno at all.  But here he is, a Hellspawn Abomination in the flesh on Earth.  You find these Abominations usually in Inferno.  But for whatever reason, Washington and others seem to love the disgusting Abomination.

Thanks,
ZULFIKAR MOINUDDIN AHMED
