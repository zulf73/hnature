\section{Result}

We find that in 2019 whites represented 60 percent of the population but committed 69.8 percent of the total rapes.  For other sorts of crimes, I will not say anything new here and concentrate on rapes.  Thus American rape rate would be 16.33 percent higher if only rapes committed white rapes were counted regardless of victim race.

Our data is directly from published figures from FBI, so they are quite reliable.

\section{Context}

I was quite sick of various ethnic theories about how blacks are over-represented in all aggressive crimes in America, and looking at the high rape rates in Iceland, Sweden, Belgium compared to most African countries I did not believe that black rape rates were higher than whites, so I checked and found easily these figures.
