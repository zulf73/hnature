\section{Motivation}

For about six months Bill Gates has been attempting to kill me using meta power in various forms.  He has done enormous harm to my life, body and soul.  He is a butcher in meta with malevolence that is exceedingly high.  I believe he ought to be killed with an excess of nuclear weapons to incinerate his body.  

He says that his behaviour is due to his white ethnicity.  

I will now show you measurements of malevolence levels in America.  

\section{Proxy: Justifiability of Violence}

Bill Gates does not employ physical violence directly against my interests; instead he uses meta powers and harms my body; he has cut up my eyes and uses horrific things like industrial machinery to mangle my flesh.  The intention to do massive harm in meta is indicative of his justifiability of violence against others to be very high.  Therefore our proxy is appropriate.  It is Q191.

First let us consider the distribution in America from 1=Never Justified to 10=Always Justified.

For America, we construct the table with $N=6179$ people, from WVS7.

\begin{verbatim}
> violtbl.us
viol.us
   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10 
1366  333  274  119  271   73   62   35    8   27 
> sum(viol.us)
[1] 6179
\end{verbatim}

Now let us look at the frequencies.

I have shown that these are all exponentially distributed, so let us consider the graph of log(x).

There is fine structure, but the fit is extremely good with $R^2=0.841$.  As a parenthetical remark, there is very little question that my discovery of empirical exponential laws for various moral qualities of Human Beings is one of the greatest advances in the history of science, before which there was only confusion in human understanding of our own moral qualities.  I have learned that one must be aggressive about promoting one's own greatness because the world is such that unworthy people like Bill Gates uses ethnicity and other criteria to deny us our proper place in the world.  I should be given many Nobel Prizes for this discovery alone, let alone be denied tenure and be harmed by Bill Gates.


\section{Isolation of Bill Gates from White People}

We will use some logical steps to place Bill Gates in his proper moral category.

We will first use the fact that he continuously claimed 'White Right' to harm me when White Law elements such as Claudia Schiffer did not find that Bill Gates had any white right to harm an American such as myself.  Bill Gates claims that White people have always been extremely violent towards nonwhites.

Based on these, we can now use the exponential fit to empirical distribution and put a conservative bound on how rare Bill Gates is among White Americans.

This gives us a very conservative bound.  Our model gives us $\lambda=0.45437$.

We can start with conservative bound that Bill Gates belongs in "Violence is Always Justified" category.  Let $P_BG$ denote the tail probability for people at least as violent as Bill Gates.

We have
\[
P_{BG} \le \exp(-10 \lambda) = 1.06\%
\]
Note that even without more accurate estimate, we can refute the claim that Bill Gates is {\em representative of white people morally}.  Among American Whites, his views of violence would be shared by no more than 1.06\% of whites, so he cannot possibly be representing White Opinion; he represents at most 1.06\% of whites.  Thus 98.94\% of whites cannot share his views of violence.  Therefore his particular chant of "Whites are Superior" do not include 98.94\% of whites when "White Right" included cutting into a nonwhite American's eyes and destroying his Ancestry and other personal meta.  So that is good.  I can isolate him from 98.94\% of white Americans.  

\section{Further refinement}

I will be trying to isolate Bill Gates from more and more white people until he is totally alone and then try to kill him.  This is a good idea.  His malevolence level is a threat to the Human Race, so I need to convince the US Government to kill him immediately.


\section{Violence Scale in $[0,\infty)$}

We now take the other track, of attempting to refine $P_{BG} \le 1.06$\%.

Let us assume around 500 white Americans are at least as fanatical about use of violence against non-whites as Bill Gates.  

\[
500/200,000,000 = e^{-\lambda x}
\]
Solve for $x$.  We obtain $x=28.39$.

This ought to roughly the right order of magnitude.  We believe his level of justifiability of violence is 1 in 200,000,000 in fact.  We have thus made progress in isolating Bill Gates from white Americans.  He is an Evil Demon, so this is sensible.

What we should do is get sufficient evidence that his moral views are in 1 in 200,000,000 in evil and then just kill the Demon with extreme prejudice.
