\begin{epigram}{You're now tuned into the motherfucking greatest

Turn the music up in the headphones

Tim, you can go and brush your shoulder off

I probably owe it to you all, proud to be locked by the force

Trying to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche

Feeling no remorse, feeling like my hand was forced

Middle finger to the law, nigga griping my balls

All the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screaming

All the ballers is bouncing they like the way I be leaning

All the rappers be hating, off the track that I'm making

But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it

Came from the bottom the bottom, to the "Top of the Pops"

Nigga London, Japan and I'm straight off the block

Like a running back, get it man, I'm straight off the block

I can run it back nigga 'cause I'm straight with the Roc}{Jay-Z, "Dirt off your Shoulders"}

\section{Interpretation}

Univariate model predicting Rape Rates from logGDP (per capita) showed rise of rape with logGDP.  Here in the multivariate model we see Murder rates fall with logGDP and rise with Single Motherhood.  

Univariate model predicting Robbery Rates rise with Single Motherhood.

We offer no theoretical explanation of these empirical discoveries.
