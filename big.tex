\section{Principles of Fate}

Fate exists in the universe and is one.  In order to sail on Fate, one requires firm faith that Fate is a torrent in the Universe that is unseen to us in meta.  Demons want to be big and powerful but they are little ripples in the ocean of Fate.  Don't always go directly in the face of ripple; let them do whatever they will do.  Instead focus on illegitimate use of Power, and trust in Fate.  After a while all things will resolve themselves.  Never believe that Power of any type is but a mirage.  It is not a mirage if you don't have faith in Fate as far more powerful.  Look at the ripples on the blank shore.  If you were tiny next to it, it is big, but if you are wiser and look deep underneath the ocean, it is fleeting and weak.  But it will destroy you if you are foolish and do not have faith that the torrent of Fate is far vaster than you can see.

\section{Specifically Only Consider Illegitimate Use of Power}

Bill Gates is a noisy Demon always repeating he is big.  He is a ripple on a blank shore.  Ripples need to continually seem big.  The torrent of the deep ocean is silent, and uncaring.  Trust the silence.
