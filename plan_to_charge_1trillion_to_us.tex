\maketitle
\section{American Plan}
I am quite American and consider seriously the Declaration of Independence whose precise language is important, and implies that when the US Government fails to secure Natural Rights of Americans against violations by various people who have no respect for American Natural Rights, that we dissolve the political ties that hold American people together and reform a new government more competently handle security of Natural Rights of the American people.  This is not un-American but purely American. 

\section{United States can easily pay \$ 1 trillion to me}

My country United States had all sorts of bloodlust and glee about snafu-ing a million civilians in Iraq but when it comes to doing it's fundamental job of securing American Natural Rights suddenly it gets squeamish about habeas corpus of murderers and criminals which does not seem to occur to US Government when using drones for instant execution without trial all over the world.  So I have absolutely no moral qualms about charging the US Government \$ 1 trillion if I don't see a proper execution of Bill Gates in a reasonable amount of time.
