Not wooing, no longer shall woing, voice that has outgrown it, shall be the nature of your cry; but instead you shall cry out as purely as a bird when the quickly ascending season picks him up, nearly forgetting that he is a suffering creature and not just a single heart being flung into brightness, into the intimate skies.
(Rilke, Seventh Elegy)

These sentiments of ecstatic joy are part of our deserved human experience; for me they are so beautiful and true, it is difficult for me to imagine that the Creator had not endowed this as part of our inviolable inalienable right -- to experience the ecstasy of love and then transcendence beyond it.  But there is a fricition that makes this more difficult, and that is that our primitive age does not provide us with a clear system for borrowing as a convenience, where money is a utility that is rationalized, and you can borrow without impossible interest rates and be able to manage your financial life with some security.  That security then facilitating people being able to focus on experiences that will allow the world to be a better for everyone.  

I imagine that one day in the future, money itself will be as clean and abundant as tap water, so that all people can get on with doing things that they were born to do without putting enormous importance to money.  

These are the considerations that led me to articulate methods for a Global Individual Debt effort.  I need \$5T from China (Europe and America could get involved too) and I will manage a large spread portfolio from San Francisco to manage this.
