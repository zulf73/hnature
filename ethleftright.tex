From far left to far right, the blue is variation due to ethnicity.  Ethnicity does not move the mean much.

\section{Zulf's Universal Law of Small Ethnicity Effect on Everything}

I will formulate my Universal Law for Ethnicity.  On almost all aspects of Life, the ethnicity effect will be low.

\section{Another Example}

Human rights are respected these days, variance is due to ethnicity. Left respected a great deal; right is not very.

A beautiful exponential curve. Now nice the little bit of variation due to Ethnicity here too.  How nice and pleasant.
