\maketitle

I have a million interesting questions to investigate and a million positive contributions yet to offer my Beloved People the Human Race.  Bill Gates is a Malevolent Criminal Cunt who has been attempting to kill me.  He is not interesting.  I am extremely irritated that United States of America has not killed the worthless Criminal Murderous Cunt yet.  I want United States to kill the worthless Criminal Cunt Bill Gates so I can get my \$120 million from D. E. Shaw \& Co. and move to San Francisco, get tenure at a top university, expand Thyself Inc. and do a million other things that are held up because for whatever reason people in United States Government do not want to kill the worthless murderous criminal cunt Bill Gates.

I am extremely irritated.  I have things to do.  I can't hold up my life because United States Government is confused about what to do with worthless murderous cunts who violate American people's Natural Rights.
