\section{Sufferings of Young Bill Gates}

\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{natrights.jpg}

Bill Gates is not a college graduate and his mindset is not different from many many high school educated white people I have encountered in America.  Partly it is because of America's relative wealth and isolation from the rest of the world.  Americans often tend to read the US Declaration of Independence as an isolated document separate from International Law.  Americans, therefore, when they are not college educated, tend to think that 'all men are created equal', articulated in the draft by Thomas Jefferson, is a matter of interpretation, and that often they come to the wrong conclusion that it means 'all white men are created equal'.  Of course the Natural Rights Doctrine developed from the moment of US Declaration of Independence to 1948, after United States won the Second World War and United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a far more refined version of the Natural Rights theory.  

\section{Provincial People Around the World Have Difficulty With Inalienable Natural Rights}

Natural Rights Doctrine was not present in Europe at all till a great deal of thought by John Locke produced the first ideas of Natural Rights, and Thomas Jefferson developed it in the founding of America in 1770s.  For most of roughly six million years of human evolutionary history, Natural Rights were not articulated and there was no concept of intrinsic inalienable rights of any person that was not granted by the parents or the local community or tribe.  I will take a look at the justification for parents to beat their children later in this note.  Natural Rights are a development of extremely lofty ambitions for universal human affairs, and it is clear from Bill Gates' attitudes that plebian illiterate people in America struggle with the difficulties of this advancement in human political thought.

\section{What Purpose Is Served By Natural Rights}

Bill Gates is still confused since he is a plebian illiterate rustic buffoon and asks "What purpose is served by Natural Rights".  In his miniscule mind, intrinsic purpose is given to Money and Acquisition of Wealth, as we know from many other sources.  But he clearly does not have any sense for the loftiness of ambition of the US Declaration of Independence, which I shall quote here again.

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed."

Here we can understand that Natural Rights are fundamental for these are truths that are self-evident.  In the American Political philosophy of the Founders, and quite widely accepted by educated literati in America, Natural Rights are fundamental for all activity of the United States Government.  In other words, it is Natural Rights that is the reference for purpose of other things and they are themselves central, self-evident, transcendent purpose in themselves.

There is indeed justification for why they are fundamental, as clearly the confused Bill Gates is unable to produce himself hierarchy of values where Natural Rights meet his small central purposes which are simply unworthy of any great soul.  The purpose of Natural Rights security, Bill Gates, is that they are foundations of flourishing Human Civilisations.  You are simply too ignorant of history to appreciate the devastation and degeneration of Civilisations that occur when societies have not secured Natural Rights.  These are the guarantors of Civilisation.  Your 'white man' was barbaric after the fall of Rome, Bill Gates, and was no better in many ways than the worst savages of our horror films of dystopian degeneration and Hobbesian environments.  It is the securing of universal Natural Rights that give us hope for continuing Civilisation.  You have managed to take advantage of Natural Rights security for yourself and grown in wealth and you will not be treated kindly when you betray the very foundations of your fortunes.
