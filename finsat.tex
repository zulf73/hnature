\section{New Vista}

On many moral values and preferences, we have shown negligible effects of ethnicity.

Now we address financial satisfaction, which is external.

This is a non-evolved trait since global economy has an effect.

Let us make simple observations.  First, most people are dissatisfied with their finances of all ethnicities.

All ethnicities except Arabs are majority dissatisfied with their finances.

\section{Zulf is Displeased}

Since the Human Race is my Beloved People, I am extremely displeased that my people are suffering and the financial dissatisfaction is chronic on Earth.

I am quite displeased about this.  I have an idea.  I can easily unfairly blame the malevolent Demon Bill Gates for the suffering of my people and then give rousing demagogic speeches to scapegoat him and blame {\em him} for the suffering of my people, and then get everyone to burn him at the stake and then solve this problem.  The solution is trivial, but I need \$5 trillion to manage from China.  This is a good idea.  He was an evil malevolent cunt in my meta anyway, so it's good vengeance.

\section{Bill Gates Ought to be Burned Alive on World Scale Broadcast}

Bill Gates ought to taken to one of those very large stadium and buckets of kerosene ought to be dumped on him.  Then he ought to be set on fire with hundreds of cameramen doing HDTV broadcast of his roasting body to billions of people live around the world.  That's the sort of way he ought to killed, in front of the entire world and burned alive till his flesh is charred.  That's what he deserves.
