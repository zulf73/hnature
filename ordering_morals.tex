\section{Combinatorial Explosion Problem}

Ordering has to be determined among 16 variables.  Now 16 factorial is outrageously large.

Here I consider alternative paths.  The path that occurs immediately is to order them by closeness to {\em stationary distribution} of the Markov generator. 

Recall from Markov Chain theory that if $P$ is the Markov generator matrix, then 
$P^m$ will tend to a matrix with all rows identical.  Then the rows are the stationary distribution.

Our algorithm is to use $P_0$ which is fit with ordering Q177--Q195 (excluding some).  Then we just reorder the variables from the right end by ordering of distance to the stationary distribution.
