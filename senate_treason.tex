\section{Execution for Treason}

Taking of human lives is a bad thing.  I am not religiously Buddhist, but I am originally from Bengal, and Buddha's thoughts and myths are part of the Bengali language and literature, and I am thus familiar with the Eastern ideas of sacredness of Life.  In America, "Right to Life" means that abortion is bad but killing millions of non-white people is just fine.  I am generally against Capital Punishment.  You would think that in America, where Natural Rights are sacred in principle, things would be different.  But American Government is crazy, and does not secure Natural Rights of non-white Americans easily.  That's why half the country is going wild with "Black Live Matter" and such things.  These US Senators need some serious threats to cajole them into doing their Constitution and Declaration mandated duty of securing my Natural Rights.  If they fail that's when we take their lives--by proper procedures.  We will accuse them of Treason, for in America Natural Rights are sacred, and refusing to secure Natural Rights of Americans is not 'tantamount to Treason'; don't get confused by rhetoric.  In America US Senators refusing or being lackadaisical about securing American Natural Rights is literally Treason and not figuratively so.

\section{Map of Where Firing Squad Can Execute 100 Senators}

That's great that Washington was built with a great spot for firing range for execution with lots of space to kill all 100 US Senators all at once.

\section{Some Historical Pictures of Firing Squad Executions}

That's great.  See in this one the man is blindfolded with a white cloth?

We can easily get 100 cotton white cloths to cover the face of 100 Senators when they are executed by a firing squad.

\section{Treason}

Treason in the old world monarchies were more about loyalty to the king or queen.  In America, things are a bit different because it is a Multi-Ethnic Classical Liberal Democratic Republic.  Here, Treason is disloyalty to {\em principles} that were established in the US Declaration and US Constitution rather than disloyalty to any particular person.  Now United States of America is quite robust, so even if 100 US Senators are killed quite quickly 100 more would be elected by the State.  Therefore not much would be actually lost by killing 100 US Senators and the Nation would not only survive but be even better because Treason against the US Declaration and US Constitution has never been punished before.

\section{Specific Charges}

Bill Gates, the criminal White Supremacist Evil Cunt, has been cutting up my eyes and harming my life in various ways for about a year.  I have asked the US Senators for months to put him to death with no response.  They are obligated and duty-bound to secure my Natural Rights and they have failed.  So we have Treason against the sacred foundations of the American Republic.
