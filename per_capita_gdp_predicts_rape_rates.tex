\section{Position of No Theory}

I was not following any theory for this result, and it's power is strong and a serendipitous discovery.  There are too many ideologies developed since the European Renaissance for me to provide a theory for this.  I present it as a triumph of empirical discovery without theory.  Caution is justified for theory here since I have been in passionate debates from radical socialism to racist right, from ardent devotees of capitalism to hard-core anti-colonial rebels from East.  It is best to take a step back from all this chaos and reflect on the result and understand it.
