\section{Illiterate Plebian Bill Gates Opinions}

Bill Gates, who is an illiterate plebian, has made some money and suddenly he thinks he's an expert on romantic success because he has a harem of young girls who are 'quite mature for their age'.  He literally told me that Valeriya, who was quite attractive physically, but decided to try to get me to buy her an Apple phone instead of loving me and getting together me, was "too hot" for me.

I don't consider any woman in the world as "too hot" for me.  It's not because I am a playboy with great record of fucking various women whose hotness is between 7--10 like an adolescent from a 1970's movie but because I am a mature Princeton-educated gentlemen and I don't worry about women's hotness levels too much when I consider any relationships at ll.  

I want illiterate plebians to produce a good model of hotness level matching with at least 100,000 participants and prove to me that hotness-level matching has any predictive relationship to relationship and marital success at all.  I don't believe this would be a serious factor in the end, but I am quite open to being proven wrong.  Why doesn't Bill Gates conduct this study instead of having glib views that will irritate me and ensure that he will be considered a total illiterate numbskull for the rest of my life in my book?
