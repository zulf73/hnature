\section{Introduction}

In America there are various horrible rumours about all sorts of people having propensity to beat their wives.  We'll take a deeper look in actual measured data.

1 & Arab & 3.16 \\ 
  2 & Black & 1.98 \\ 
  3 & East Asian & 0.46 \\ 
  4 & Indian & 0.11 \\ 
  5 & Other & 0.77 \\ 
  6 & White & 1.50 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

None of these effects are particularly strong.  Let's look at the percentages that are in 1-5 (don't find beating wife justifiable).

\begin{tabular}{rlr}
  \hline
 & eth & good \\ 
  \hline
1 & Arab & 94.16 \\ 
  2 & Black & 94.47 \\ 
  3 & East Asian & 95.39 \\ 
  4 & Indian & 97.69 \\ 
  5 & Other & 92.92 \\ 
  6 & White & 94.23 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

There is no significant difference at all between percentages of Arabs, Whites, Blacks in those who find wife beating unjustified.

\section{Conclusion}

Don't have prejudices against other people considering them 'wife beaters'.  This is highly offensive and wrong.
