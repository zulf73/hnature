\section{My Natural Rights Are Secured By US Government}

Bill Gates, my Natural Rights are secured by US Government.  Eventually you will be bombed and obliterated for violating them egregiously.

Why don't you avoid that by following through with your idea that you can buy elections and buy 50 state governors, 100 US Senators, 535 US Congressmen.  Just put White Supremacists at each of the slots and then you can change US foundations and nix my Natural Rights Security.  It will be like the Nazi Party taking over Germany.  Why don't you buy all the elections and then declare US an Empire and yourself as Emperor?  

Until you succeed in doing that, unfortunately, I will get US to bomb and obliterate you physically.  I don't think you will be able to stall it forever.
