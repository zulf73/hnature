\section{What are Hobbes Exponential Tails?}

\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{synthterror.jpeg}

May 3 2021.  I discovered a synthetic graph from data for justifiability of political violence.  You can see the right tail of the sythetic distribution curling up a bit.  We consider some values as mixture of opposing exponentials; the main body near the origin is exponential and we call it the Rousseau exponential and the opposing much smaller mass exponential we call Hobbes exponential.  It is a stylised fact that for Good-Evil axis for justifiability of various moral transgressions, the Rousseau tail dominates strongly.

\section{Hobbes Tails Exist for all Ethnicities}

We found recently that for justifiability of terrorist violence Whites have significantly higher weight in the Hobbes Exponential than Arabs.  This is important to remove anti-Arab prejudices due to war propaganda in America and Europe in the past two decades.  But it is also a fact that all ethnicities have some Hobbes Exponential Tail.  It is a scientific mystery to understand the factors that explain these people.

\section{High Probability of Universal Factors Driving Hobbes Exponential Tails}

Previously I found models of rapes around the world using various ethnicity-dependent factors (including per capita GDP).  I do not actually believe that there is any ethnicity-specific 'Violence factor'; these sorts of hypotheses are quite bad science.  I worked hard to remove some prejudices about crimes and black people by pointing out that white overrepresent rapes by FBI statistics compared to American blacks.

These are to defuse racist prejudices of whites rather than to produce scientific understanding of the Hobbes Exponential Tails.  

I want to be clear that I do not think that ethnicity is ever an explanation for these things; the underlying factors need to be found, and I expect them to have universal character.  This is simple inference for East Asians and Indians also have Hobbes Exponential Tails, only slightly lower than Whites.  So we can eliminate ethnic explanations for existence of Hobbes Exponential Tails.  

\section{World Values Survey Has Many Possible Factors}

We have succeeded in modeling a finer version of Exponential distributions with Hobbes Exponential Tails for some variables (such as support for terrorist violence) which is an important step for we will be able to separate out the Rousseau end from the Hobbes end quantitatively.  But the factors that explain the Hobbes end is totally mysterious and open.  I don't like speculating on factors till I have some statistical models that have good fits.  This we ought to do and ensure that we have explanations that are not irrational and stupid such as "Why did Johnny Rumpadumpa believe that political violence is the only way for people to have better lives?"  and some idiot answers "Well, you see Johnny Rumpadumpa is totally white.  He's so Anglo and White that Queen of England refuses him Visa to England because he'll claim the Crown all by his torso.  So for that reason he's into ultra-violence."  These sorts of explanations do not impress Zulf.

\section{High School Educated People are over-represented in White Terrorism Supporters}

The factors that predict "Political Violence Is Justified" at levels 9--10 are opaque.  I discovered a significant portion  have high school education as highest achievement.

This goes from general population fraction of $13.17\%$ to terrorism extremist supporters of $27.93\%$. So that is one interesting feature.
