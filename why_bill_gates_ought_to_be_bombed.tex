\maketitle

United States of America is founded on securing of Natural Rights for all Americans including myself.  Now Bill Gates is an American in a way, since he was born in America in 1955, but he does not respect Natural Rights, and calls Natural Rights 'claptrap'. He malevolently cut into my eyes and put hard meta into my soft meta in order to control me and harm me.  This began with use of US War Meta to damage my Body meta, which harmed me a great deal as well. He rotted my teeth, hired Demonics to harm me, and did many other things that are far in excess of violating my Natural Rights based on White Supremacy principles.  

For these reasons, I advocate relentless bombing of Bill Gates till he is physically dead.  

I am not certain if US Senate will accomplish this necessary task; for the United States Government is actually obligated to secure my Natural Rights, that is the purpose of American Government, and I will push to firing squad the entire US Senate if they do not kill Bill Gates because then it will be quite clear that they are corrupt and White Supremacist minions of Bill Gates.
