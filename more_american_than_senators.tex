\section{Americanness}

Since America was founded on Universal Natural Rights Security as a nation (see US Declaration), I can claim to be {\em more American} than anyone in the US Senate the moment I have been a victim of gruesome and barbaric and heinous violation of my Natural Rights by the Evil Malevolent White Supremacist Bill Gates while still championing Natural Rights for all people of the world and their security while the US Senators are neither the victim of assault to their Natural Rights nor do they advocate security of Natural Rights for all people of the world.  

Given this is the case, I can claim to be far more American than all of them, and then push for firing squad execution of all 100 US Senators without resistance because by failing to secure my Natural Rights and cozying up to the criminals who are violating my Natural Rights they were in dereliction of their duties to the American People since they violated purpose of American Government from US Declaration. Then if they are found guilty of actually conspiring with the Evil Malevolent White Supremacist Bill Gates, the American People will be only too glad to see them executed by a firing squad and then America will be rejuvenated and a new day will dawn for those who stand long and the forest will echo with laughter.
