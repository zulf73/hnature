\section{Introduction}
In this note I will show you some global social problems and suggest new ways to approach them with the assistance of songs.  These are two of my favourite songs.  Actually I am 48 and have huge numbers of favourite songs that I have accumulated over the decades.  But these two were addictive.  LSD's {\em Thunderclouds} and The Decembrist's {\em Why We Fight}.  

\section{Mixing the Songs}

\begin{verse}
Come the war
Come the avarice
Come the war
Come hell

Come attrition
Come the reek of bones
Come attrition
Come hell

This is why
Why we fight
Why we lie awake
And this is why
This is why we fight

When we die
We will die
With our arms unbound

Where’d the love go?
When all is said and done
Hey now I got your hands in the air
I’ma go through your stuff
Where’d the love go?

This is why
Why we fight
Why we lie awake
And this is why
This is why we fight

Babe, you got it wrong
Please turn your fears into trust, to trust

Bride of quiet
Bride of all unquiet things
Bride of quiet
Bride of hell

Come the archers
Come the infantry
Come the archers
Of hell

This is why
Why we fight
Why we lie awake
This is why
This is why we fight

And when we die
We will die
With our arms unbound
And this is why
This is why we fight
Come hell
Come hell

You’re sayin’ those words like you hate me now (wo-oah)
Our house is burning when you’re raising hell (wo-oah)
Here in the ashes your soul cries out (a-a-ah)
But don’t be afraid of these thunderclouds
These thunderclouds, oh, no
These thunderclouds, oh, no, no
These thunderclouds, oh, no
These thunderclouds, oh, no, no

So come to me
Come to me now
Lay your arms around me
And this is why
This is why
We fight
Come hell
Come hell

You’re sayin’ those words like you hate me now (wo-oah)
Our house is burning when you’re raising hell (wo-oah)
Here in the ashes your soul cries out (a-a-ah)
But don’t be afraid of these thunderclouds
These thunderclouds, oh, no
These thunderclouds, oh, no, no
These thunderclouds, oh, no
These thunderclouds, oh, no, no

\end{verse}

\section{Conclusions}

Transformations require music and precision too.  Natural changes require art, and without understanding the music of the human soul, all sorts of social programs will not do a single thing.  This note is just suggestive.  

See, if you just did arithmetic of life satisfaction you do not understand the human soul.  The addition and subtraction requires poetry, mythology, and genuinely new relationships.
