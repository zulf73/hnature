\section{To Whom Is The Curse Addressed}

All people of Earth who have a position of "Hold Off" on  "Seek and Destroy of Bill Gates"

\section{Duration of the Curse}

Eternity.
 
\section{The Curse}

I wish to formally curse the higher ups of Justice Department and other US Government Agencies who have ordered "Hold off" on Bill Gates.  May all your progeny be dented by Industrial meta damaging their exoskeleton and may the butchers of the world cut up all their internal organs including their physical brains, and may their health be very bad till they are all paralysed and may the world not care all that much about their health and support the butchers of the world when that happens.  

\section{Possibility of Change}

Never in Eternal Future.  This Curse is the right decision, is proper, just, and perfect.  I will never apologise for this in the future, and vow never to renege or alter it.  It is an expression of my deepest soul, and it is immutable.
