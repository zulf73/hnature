\maketitle

Bill Gates was born in 1955 to a privileged American white family and had the opportunity to simply absorb by normal education to ordinary values of Western Civilization, which are well-understood and I won't go into what they are.  


Bill Gates decided that he's too good for the values of Western Civilization, and then he pursued power and money with the conviction that 'power makes its own values'.  

Then he dismissed all Western Values as 'trivia' and pretended that various profound considerations of great genius were at work for the formulation of his values.  In reality he did not study, and relaxed into instinctive values that were primitive, savage, and chimpanzee-like as a result of failure to habituate to ordinary Western Civilization values.  

Then he decided that his values were superior to ordinary Western Civilization values, and refused to pay attention to empirical data or the work of profound Western geniuses, considering Natural Rights to be "PR", and morality to be 'hoax' and other arrogant noise to {\em choose} primitive, savage, chimpanzee-like values and considering thus acquired values as superior to ordinary organic values of Western Civilization.  

Now for most people, this is a bizarre route to take, but Bill Gates' arrogance and narcissism led to his conviction that his primitive savage chimpanzee values are the answer to the problems of the world.  

\section{Moral of the story}
You can't improve upon the values of a Civilization if you don't spend effort learning what they are and posing as though you are too good to study and learn them.
